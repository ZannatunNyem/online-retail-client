## 📖 Project Overview

**Online Retail Client** is a modern and responsive e-commerce frontend application built with **React** and **Vite**.

Users can browse products and view product details without logging in. However, authentication is required to add products to the cart or proceed to checkout.

After logging in, users can:

- Add products to their personal cart  
- Create a Personal Profile
- Complete the purchase process through a dedicated checkout page  

This application is designed to work with a backend API that manages authentication, product data, and user-specific cart information.
